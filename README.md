Hello, This project you see is an atm application with simple python codes. I have written it all myself from start to finish and I share it with you valuable users.
To use the application, you must first assign your account information as username and password to the arrays. After running, you must enter the username and password correctly. Otherwise it will not work. In the running application, you must select the operation you want to do in the incoming menu and follow the necessary steps.
I added the english version on the bottom of code page
